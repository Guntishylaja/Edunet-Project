Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

Overview:

This project demonstrates how to securely hide and retrieve secret data within an image using steganography techniques. Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another medium, making the hidden data undetectable to the naked eye.

Features:

Securely hide sensitive data inside an image

Extract the hidden data from the modified image

Uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method for embedding data

Encryption support for additional security

Prerequisites:

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

NumPy

Cryptography (for encryption)

Install dependencies using:

pip install pillow numpy cryptography

Usage:

Hiding Secure Data

Prepare an image (e.g., input.png).

Run the encoding script:

python hide_data.py input.png "Your secure data" output.png

The modified image (output.png) will contain the securely hidden data.

Extracting the Data

Run the decoding script on the modified image:

python extract_data.py output.png

The script will reveal the hidden data.

Example:

python hide_data.py sample.png "Confidential Info" hidden_sample.png
python extract_data.py hidden_sample.png

Expected output:

Hidden Data: Confidential Info

Security Considerations:

Encrypt data before hiding for enhanced security.

Avoid using compressed image formats (e.g., JPEG) as they may distort hidden data.

Use high-resolution images for better concealment.
